# Networking_for_BigData-Labs_Assignment1
Part 1: 
1. Use library scripts to generate p-ER random graphs and
r-regular random graph. Let K denote the number of nodes.
2. Write a script to check the connectivity of a given graph.
algebraic method 1 (irreducibility);
algebraic method 2 (eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix);
breadth-first search algorithm.
3. Compare the complexity as a function of K of the methods
above by plotting curves of a complexity measure vs K.
4. Let pc (G) denote the probability that a graph G is connected.
By running Monte Carlo simulations, estimate pc (G) and
produce two curve plots:
pc (G) vs. p for Erd ̋os-R ́enyi graphs with K = 100.
pc (G) vs. K, for K ≤ 100, for r-regular random graphs with
r = 2 and r = 8.
